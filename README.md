<h3><b>DokiArch Linux</b> is a Linux distribution <b>made for the pwros</b>, based on ArchLinux Arm</h3><br />

</div>

## Is it safe to use?
It is strongly suggested to <b>do not use this Linux distribution as daily drive</b>, since it is not made by a team of experts and there are way better distros out there. <br />
If you want to use it anyways, DokiArch relies on Arch Linux Arm standard repositories, so for normal packages you will receive frequent updates that do not depend on us.
